Unofficial site for the discord server [\~üçû\~](https://example.com).
Majority of the code forked(/stolen) from [Grizz#7960/POPE44](https://github.com/POPE44/)'s [site](https://github.com/POPE44/pope44.github.io/blob/main/ori.html), for the server [Ori'Suumyc](https://discord.com/invite/Ge2RfEJYSJ).
All pictures created by Sweden/LimeLeff#7922.

Altogether really just created because I wanted to see how much HTML/CSS I still remembered, and to try to get some sort of grip on how github works.
